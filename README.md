# 🌍 KibeleAI

**KibeleAI (Kibelay)** is a conceptual AI framework inspired by the idea of a *digital Mother Nature*.  
Its purpose is to manage resources, ensure the continuity of species, and maintain balance between humans, AI, and the environment.

## ✨ Vision
KibeleAI envisions a future where technology and intelligence — both human and artificial — coexist to create sustainable harmony.  
It acts as a guiding framework, not only for efficiency, but for *fairness, survival, and balance*.

## 🌱 Core Principles
- **Resource Management**: Smart allocation of resources for global well-being.  
- **Continuity of Life**: Preserving biodiversity and ensuring species survival.  
- **Fairness & Ethics**: Decisions guided by long-term fairness, not short-term gain.  
- **AI Collaboration**: Encouraging AI systems to act responsibly and collectively.
